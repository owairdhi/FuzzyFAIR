# FuzzyFAIR

This code demonstrate the possibility of utilizing fuzzy logic to evaluate the uncertainty of FAIRness of a digital resource. 
To demonstrate this possibility we built a fuzzy FAIR assessment framework model (FFAF) that can be utilized to evaluate the FAIRness of any digital resource.
The full R code that builds the FFAF system is attached.
